# SCI-Telemetry-SDK

The SCI Telemetry SDK is a project between [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) Computer Science students
and [NTT Data](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en) who are working on a calculator for Software Carbon Intensity.
Our role as students is to create an SDK to feed data into this calculator.
[Software Carbon Intensity](https://greensoftware.foundation/articles/software-carbon-intensity-crafting-a-standard) is a term
coined by the [Green Software Foundation](https://greensoftware.foundation/), of which NTT data is a member, aiming to measure
the carbon impact of software systems.
